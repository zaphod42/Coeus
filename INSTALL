The Provisioning Description Language

To setup the system for working with PDL (without installing it):

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    export PERL5LIB=`pwd`/blib/lib

After this you should be able to run the PDL interpreter without
having to install it on your system.

For documentation run:

    ./pdl.pl --man

This program requires Parse::RecDescent and Regexp::Common 
to be installed on the system (install them via CPAN).  To use 
the PDL::Visual::DotMapper mapping module you will also need to have 
Graph::Easy installed.  To be able to view the generated GraphViz dot 
file you will need to have GraphViz installed as well (you can try to 
read the file, but it is not made for human consumption).

For running the tests the only additional package that should
be required is Test::Deep.  To run the tests run

    ./Build test

from the root of the PDL distro.
